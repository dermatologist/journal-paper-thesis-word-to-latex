# paperaj-template - Write jounal papers or thesis in word and convert to LaTeX for submission! (All using GitHub actions!)

TL;DR: **You can use any LaTeX template! Sections in the word document ([see main.docx](main.docx)) with italicized headings are split into latex files that can be included into your template. See example in [main.tex](main.tex) and [inclusions.tex](inclusions.tex). The latex files in [paperaj/](paperaj/) folder are autogenerated by the GitHub action from the word document!**

## This is a template that uses [paperaj](https://github.com/dermatologist/paperaj) as a GitHub action.

Paperaj is a combination of bash and python scripts for converting MS word document to a latex document for academic journals. You can use any journal template for latex compilation. This can be used as a standalone script (needs pandoc and latex installed) or as a GitHub action. **Just create a repo from this template that uses [Paperaj](https://github.com/dermatologist/paperaj) GitHub action and the GitHub will latex-compile your manuscript!**

## How it works
Paperaj creates a set of plain latex files from the word document in the paperaj folder. Images, tables and referencing are supported during the conversion. These plain latex files can be included in the journal's latex template using: ``` \input{filename} ```. See [main.docx](https://github.com/dermatologist/paperaj-public-template/blob/master/main.docx) in the template for word document format. See [main.tex](https://github.com/dermatologist/paperaj-public-template/blob/master/main.tex) in the template to see how you can include paperaj generated latex files in the latex entry file. Just use this template that uses [Paperaj GitHub action](https://github.com/dermatologist/paperaj) and the **GitHub will latex-compile your manuscript!**
